# readme.md

Hi, I'm barely active on github because I'm too lazy to update my repos or contribute, but you can dm me on discord (.qazwsx#9871) where I'm online practically all day.
I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Java, Kotlin, and C#. Although I am not very competent in any of these, you can request me to make a simple program and I'll do it for free if I happen to have enough time.
